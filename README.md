# MegaAC7-SkinCopier
A tool capable of duplicating Ace Combat 7's Skin Pawns to simplify the modding process.

## Functionality
The tool needs the usage of UAssetGUI in order to work properly. https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI

UAssetGUI is capable of extracting JSON files of skin pawns (which are named `AcePlayerPawn_xxxx_syy`) and this tool is capable of reading them in order to proceed with the duplication procedure. It also allows the user to select the amount of duplicates (SkinID, specifically) along with a re-name of the internal aircraft name (AircraftID).
